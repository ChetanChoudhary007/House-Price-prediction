Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features and attributes. This README.md file will guide you through the project's structure, usage, and how to get started.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of houses based on their characteristics such as location, size, and other features. This can provide valuable insights to buyers and sellers in the real estate market.

## Installation

To get started with the project, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have set up the environment, you can start using the project. Here's how:

1. Load and preprocess your data:
   - Ensure you have the necessary dataset (e.g., California Housing dataset) in a compatible format.
   - Update the appropriate data loading and preprocessing steps in the code.

2. Run the model training and evaluation scripts:
   ```
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```

3. The script will load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Training

The project involves training a house price prediction model using the XGBoost Regressor algorithm. The script `house_price_prediction.py` handles the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Evaluation

The evaluation of the model's performance is done using metrics such as R-squared score and mean absolute error. The script also includes visualizations to help understand the relationship between predicted and actual house prices.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve this project! If you find any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
